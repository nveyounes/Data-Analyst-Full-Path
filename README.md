## ⭐ Project Goal: Become A Data Analyst

This repository demonstrates the successful execution of an end-to-end data analysis workflow, covering the core skills required on the full Data Analyst path, aligning with the industry-recognized **Data Analyst Roadmap** (See: [roadmap.sh/data-analyst](https://roadmap.sh/data-analyst)).

The main objective was to **[State the overarching business/analytical question or goal, emphasizing the end-to-end nature.]**

### 📌 Key Analytical Concepts Demonstrated
* **Mastering Data Handling** (Cleanup, Transformation).
* **Generating Descriptive Statistics** and exploring distributions.
* **Creating Visualizations** for clear insight communication.
* **[Optional: Add a higher-level concept like Statistical Analysis or Basic ML]**

## 📂 Data & Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Source
* **Source:** [Specify data source, e.g., "Kaggle dataset on Retail Sales," "Local CSV file," "SQL Database dump," etc.]
* **Format:** [e.g., CSV Files, Databases, APIs].

### 2. Data Cleanup & Handling
The project began by focusing on **Mastering Data Handling** to ensure data quality:
* Handling **Missing Data** (Imputation or Removal).
* Removing **Duplicates** and ensuring data consistency.
* Finding and treating **Outliers**.
* Applying necessary **Data Transformation** (e.g., feature engineering).

### 3. Descriptive Analysis & Insights
The core analysis focused on **Descriptive Analysis** to understand the dataset's characteristics and relationships.

* **[Insert Analysis 1 Title Here]:** The average **[Metric, e.g., 'customer lifetime value']** was **[Result]**, suggesting **[Insight]**.
* **[Insert Analysis 2 Title Here]:** Distribution analysis (using Histograms/Box Plots) showed that **[Observation]**.

### 4. Key Visualizations
Effective visualization was used to communicate findings clearly to stakeholders.

* **[Chart Type 1, e.g., Stacked Charts/Histograms]:** Used to compare the **[Comparison Metric]** across **[Category]**.
    * *Example File:* `bar_chart_sales_by_region.png`
* **[Chart Type 2, e.g., Scatter Plot/Line Chart]:** Used to investigate **[Relationship/Trend]** over time or between two variables.
    * *Example File:* `scatter_plot_price_vs_demand.png`
